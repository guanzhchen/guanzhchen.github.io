### About Me

I am a second-year master student at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) (SYSU), supervised by Dr. [Shangsong Liang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/4569).
Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree at [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) (CQU) in 2021.

My long-term research goal is to make machines speak and write like humans with knowledges.
In particular, I am mainly interested in **language models** and **knowledge graphs**.
For the language models, I am recently working on
- facilitating large language models (with knowledge) for understanding and generation;
- utilising large-scale pretrained language models by parameter-efficient way.<br>

For the knowledge graphs, I focus on knowledge graph injection for language models and knowledge graph representation.
